Contact You can send us general inquiries on the page “Contact Us”. To process this data, we collect your contact details (name and email address). This data, as well as any correspondence that is exchanged, will be saved and used by us to improve the services Luxury Treats offers you. 
Internet Connection Information When you visit a page from Luxury Treats N.V., we may collect your IP address, the date and time of your visit, the retrieved data and the version of your browser, as well as any information that is submitted by default.

Data that is visible at all times are username, age and residence. You can change these settings at any time. Luxury Treats does not publish any personal data unless you have specifically given us consent to do so. 
Should you participate in the Luxury Treats Content Community, your bank details are required for paying out the miles you earned if you select a direct transfer for your payment type. If you do not select a direct transfer, you can use the services from PayPal or Skrill. We require this information in order to disburse the miles you have earned and traded for cash starting at 10.00€ at your request. The Luxury Treats user account and the information held therein are password-protected so that only the user has access to this personal information. The user can edit this member profile at any time. We strongly recommend that you do not give your password to any third parties. Luxury Treats will never ask you for your password in unexpected or unsolicited emails. Remember to log out of your Luxury Treats member account and close your browser window after you end your session. This ensures that no one else can access your personal information and your correspondence if you share a computer with multiple people or you use a computer in public areas like internet cafes or university computing centers.

App By using our app, we may collect information about what mobile device you use to visit the site. We receive this information through your mobile device’s UDID (unique device identifier). This is a code that is unique and only attributable to your device. Likewise, we collect information such as your IP address, your operating system and the browser you are using and how you use your apps. 
If you allow GPS positioning on your mobile device, your GPS data can be used to determine your exact location and to show you nearby hotels. You can prevent access to your GPS data by selecting the appropriate settings on your mobile device. 
In the event that the app crashes, you can send the respective error report by which we constantly try to improve the usage of the app. The type of mobile device you use, your UDID, the time of the error, the used feature and the status of the app in case of failure will be transmitted via such reports. It is also possible that your personal settings will be transmitted to us, though you can change this in your mobile device’s settings at any time.

In some cases, disclosure to national and international authorities and/or courts due to prior administrative or judicial order is required by law. In these cases, the transfer is made in compliance with the legal requirements and only if the disclosure is necessary.
